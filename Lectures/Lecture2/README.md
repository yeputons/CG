## Assignment â„–2: "Marching Cubes"

1. Select a scalar function in 3d space. You can either use:
    * A [3d noise](https://gist.github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/670c22f3966e662d2f83)
    * A 3d texture generated in advance
    * *f = sum of (R/distanceToPoint^2)* from a few points scattered randomly in 3d space. (A.K.A [metaballs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaballs))
2. Change MeshGenerator.cs in such a way, that it creates a surface of f(x, y, z) = c using marching cubes algorithm. Use both vertex position interpolation and normal vector interpolation.
3. For your convenience, the tables for triangleCount and triangleEdges are located in a class `MarchingCubes.Tables`.
4. Send me a screenshot of your results at mischapanin@gmail.com along with your code (best as a link to a repository, but an archive will work).
5. The e-mail should have the following topic: __HSE.CG.<your_name>.<your_last_name>.HW2__

Bonus points:
You can get an extra 10% bonus if you generate the vertices on GPU using a compute shader.    
An example of a compute shader can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Unity3D/comments/7pa6bq/drawing_mandelbrot_fractal_using_gpu_compute/).    
A small tip: it would probably be convenient to output the results as an [AppendStruturedBuffer](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/ComputeBufferType.Append.html) of triangle structs.    

We most likely won't get to talk about compute shaders in our cource, so this is probably the best time to try them out.
